                <h3>Part I: Reflections on My Experiences in ENG2003</h3>
                <p>My overall experience in ENG2003: Effective Engineering Communication has been both eye-opening and transformative. Coming into the course, I expected it to primarily focus on technical writing, but I quickly realized that it offered a more comprehensive approach to communication, integrating public speaking, technical writing, collaborative teamwork, and audience-centered strategies. The course far exceeded my expectations by highlighting the importance of not just conveying technical information, but doing so in a way that is engaging, clear, and accessible to a range of audiences.</p>
                
                <p>The course content that I found most useful was the focus on audience-centered communication. As engineers, we often communicate with a variety of audiences, ranging from technical peers to non-technical stakeholders. Understanding how to adjust my communication style based on the audience's needs was something I hadn't fully appreciated before. The content on structuring reports and oral presentations was especially valuable, as I had to apply these skills in real-world assignments. The 7 C's of Communication became a crucial framework that I referred to during every project, ensuring that I was clear, concise, and correct in my communication. These principles were indispensable when I had to write technical reports or deliver presentations, as they helped me stay focused on what mattered most to my audience.</p>
                
                <p>The most interesting topic in the course was the ethical implications of AI. I had never thought about how technology, specifically AI, intersects with ethics and social responsibility. This project made me reflect on the Axioms of Communication, especially the idea that communication is irreversible. As AI systems are deployed in the real world, the decisions made in their design and implementation can have lasting consequences. This project not only deepened my technical knowledge but also helped me understand the social responsibility that comes with engineering practice.</p>

                <h3>Part II: Reflections on My Growth and Development as an Effective Communicator</h3>
                <p>Before ENG2003, my communication skills were largely focused on technical tasks and academic presentations, where I was comfortable conveying information but didn't always consider the audience's background or how they might interpret the message. Since taking ENG2003, I've significantly evolved as a communicator by learning how to adapt my communication style depending on the context and the audience. Whether it's presenting to a class, working with a team, or explaining technical concepts to people outside of my field, I've become more aware of the need to communicate clearly, while also engaging and tailoring my message to the audience's level of understanding. For instance, in the AI Ethics project, I had to communicate complex concepts like algorithmic bias and data privacy in a way that was accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences, ensuring that I maintained accuracy without overwhelming them with jargon.</p>

                <p>Beyond the course, I also had opportunities to meet new people and work on diverse communicative projects. Whether it was collaborating on the green roofs presentation or engaging in informal group discussions, these experiences pushed me to refine my ability to listen actively, offer constructive feedback, and engage in meaningful dialogue. These experiences showed me that communication isn't just about expressing ideas, but also about understanding others' perspectives and working together towards a common goal. I learned how to adjust my tone, be more engaging, and use visual aids effectively to support my ideas. For example, in the green roofs project, we used visuals to convey complex environmental data in a way that resonated with our audience, improving how we communicated our research findings.</p>

                <p>Outside of academic projects, I also applied these lessons in my daily life and at work, where I found that effective communication is just as important in casual conversations as it is in formal settings. Whether explaining a concept to a colleague or presenting ideas to a group in a meeting, I've worked on becoming more clear, concise, and adaptable in my communication style. I also realized the importance of non-verbal communication and how it can enhance or detract from the message being delivered, especially when interacting with people from different backgrounds or disciplines.</p>

                <p>Despite these improvements, I recognize areas where I still need to work on, particularly engaging my audience more dynamically. I'd like to further develop my skills in visual storytelling and making my presentations more interactive, which will help me capture and maintain the audience's attention. Additionally, I continue to focus on simplifying complex ideas, ensuring that the information I present is accessible without losing its technical depth.</p>

                <p>Overall, ENG2003 has been pivotal in refining my communication skills, but meeting new people, working on collaborative projects, and applying these skills in daily life have been just as integral to my growth. As I move forward in my academic and professional career, I feel better equipped to communicate effectively in a wide range of contexts, ensuring that my message is both clear and engaging, whether in group work, team collaborations, or future engineering practice.</p>
